	 *  To initialize the component, this function must be called first. When
	 *  the initialization was succesfull, an internal 'trigger component'
	 *  is created, which can accept messages from another thread. When this
	 *  happens, a signal is sent to the main component, causing it to
	 *  generate a MIPSYSTEMMESSAGE_TYPE_ISTIME message.
	 *  \param count Instead of sending a signal to the main component on each
	 *               incoming message, it is also possible to skip a number
	 *               of messages each time. If this parameter is 1 or less,
	 *               each message will cause a signal to be sent. If the value
	 *               is 2 for example, every other message will cause a signal
	 *               to be sent.
	 *  \param safetyTimeout Because this component will be waiting for signals
	 *                       from another chain, problems would arise if that
	 *                       chain crashed for example. To avoid this, a background
	 *                       thread is started which checks if a signal has been
	 *                       sent in the time interval specified by \c safetyTimeout.
	 *                       If not, the thread itself will send a signal to force
	 *                       progress in this component's chain.
