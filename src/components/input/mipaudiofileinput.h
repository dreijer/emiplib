/** A sound file input component.

 *  \c libaudiofile library to accomplish this. This component accepts MIPSYSTEMMESSAGE_TYPE_ISTIME
 *  messages, so a timing component should sent its messages to the component. The
 *  output messages contain raw audio in 16 bit integer encoding.
 *  \note A frame consists of a number of samples (equal to the number of channels)
 *        sampled at the same instant. For example, in a stereo sound file, one
 *        frame would consist of two samples: one for the left channel and one for
 *        the right.
