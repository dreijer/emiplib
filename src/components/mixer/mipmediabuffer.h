/** Holds incoming messages until they're needed by a mixer further on in the chain.
 *  This component accepts all kinds of media messages and stores incoming messages.
 *  To be able to function correctly, the component needs to receive feedback information
 *  from a mixer further on in the chain. Each iteration, the component outputs the
 *  messages required by the mixer in that interval. Furthermore, the messages are
 *  output in an ordered manner, beginning with the message with the smallest time
 *  setting.
 *  
 *  To see why this component is useful, consider the following part of a component
 *  chain:
 *  \image html nobufferchain.png
 *
 *  In the example above, it is assumed that feedback information flows from the mixer
 *  to the RTP decoder. The way the example works is as follows: an RTP component
 *  sends received RTP packets to the RTP decoder. The decoder will calculate the
 *  timing information to be used when the data will be inserted in the mixer's
 *  output stream and will create an appropriate message. A certain amount of buffering
 *  will be introduced to compensate for jitter. Let's assume that the
 *  data which was received is Speex encoded audio data, which is why we'll send it
 *  to a Speex decoder component. This component will transform the Speex data into
 *  raw audio data and will pass this to the mixer which will insert the raw audio
 *  data in the right position.
 *
 *  The problem with this setup is that packets are passed to the Speex decoder in the
 *  same order as they're received by the RTP component. When network conditions are
 *  bad however, packets can arrive out of order frequently. Since the Speex decoder
 *  uses an internal state based upon the processed packets, feeding packets to the
 *  decoder in the wrong order will case this state to become corrupted and very
 *  bad quality audio will be produced. So, although buffering is introduced to compensate
 *  for jitter, the quality of the sound will still be bad since the packets arrive
 *  at the Speex decoder in the wrong order.
 *
 *  The solution to the problem is to place a MIPMediaBuffer instance in the chain,
 *  in the following way:
 *  \image html bufferchain.png
 *
 *  As explained above, the MIPMediaBuffer instance will store incoming messages. At
 *  each iteration, it will inspect which messages will be needed by the mixer during
 *  this iteration. These messages will be ordered and sent to the output of the
 *  component. This way, the amount of buffering introduced to compensate for jitter
 *  is used to try to send the messages to the Speex decoder in the right order. Note
 *  that the component itself does not introduce extra delay.
