	 *  a certain point in the chain, messages will be extracted from pPullComponent using its implementation
	 *  of MIPComponent::pull and will be fed to pPushComponent using its MIPComponent::push implementation.
	 *
	 *  Note that no copies are made of these components, the actual components specified by the MIPComponent
	 *  pointers are used in the chain. For this reason, as long as the chain will be used, these MIPComponent
	 *  objects must exist.
	 *  
	 *  Messages can be filtered both on type and on subtype. By default, all messages are allowed over a
	 *  link between components, but it is also possible to only allow specific kinds of messages to be
	 *  passed over that link. Filtering can be done using the parameters allowedMessageTypes and
	 *  allowedSubmessageTypes. For example, to only allow LPC compressed audio messages to be passed over a
	 *  connection, allowedMessageTypes should be set to MIPMESSAGE_TYPE_AUDIO_ENCODED and allowedSubmessageTypes
	 *  should be set to MIPENCODEDAUDIOMESSAGE_TYPE_LPC.
	 *
	 *  If the feedback flag is set to true, a MIPFeedback message will be passed over this link. This way,
	 *  it is possible to provide feedback (about introduced delay for example) to components higher up
	 *  in the chain.
