/** This class provides a wrapper around another component, essentially

 *  This class provides a wrapper around another component, essentially
 *  providing a different pointer to the same object.
 *
 * In the documentation on the main page, the following example was used
 * to illustrate how different branches in a chain may merge again:
 *
 * \image html subchains1.png
 *
 * It was also explained why the following chain was not a good choice,
 * as it can cause some synchronization problems:
 * \image html subchains3.png
 *
 * The basic problem was that in this case the lengths of the branches
 * are not equal, which can cause a packet being extracted from the audio
 * mixer \em before the sampling rate converter passes another packet to
 * this mixer. To solve this, either the first chain shown above can be
 * used, or a MIPComponentAlias can be used:
 *
 * \image html subchains2.png
 *
 * In this chain, the alias is simply a wrapper around the previous
 * soundfile input component, and the dotted connection indicates
 * that we won't really be passing any messages between the component
 * and its alias (so we won't send messages from the component to
 * itself).
 * The link from the component alias to the mixer will then effectively
 * pass messages from the soundfile input component to the mixer.
 * The subchains now have an equal length, avoiding the synchronization
 * problem mentioned earlier.
 *
 * Here is some code which illustrates how this is done, the full
 * source code can be found in \c examples/multiplesoundfileplayer.cpp , in which
 * the effect of the other two chains can be heard as well. First,
 * we'll define the components in the chain:
 *
 * \code
 * 	MIPTime interval(1.000); // one second intervals
 * 	MIPAverageTimer timer(interval);
 * 	MIPWAVInput sndFileInput2;
 * 	MIPComponentAlias alias(&sndFileInput2);
 * 	MIPWAVInput sndFileInput1;
 * 	MIPSamplingRateConverter sampConv;
 * 	MIPAudioMixer mixer;
 * 	MIPSampleEncoder sampEnc;
 * #ifndef WIN32
 * 	MIPOSSInputOutput sndCardOutput;
 * #else
 * 	MIPWinMMOutput sndCardOutput;
 * #endif
 * \endcode
 *
 * As you can see, we have specified that a component named 'alias' will
 * actually refer to one of the soundfile input components. Then, we
 * shall build the chain by specifying the start component and the
 * connections in the chain:
 *
 * \code
 * 	returnValue = chain.setChainStart(&timer);
 * 	checkError(returnValue, chain);
 * 
 * 	returnValue = chain.addConnection(&timer, &sndFileInput1);
 * 	checkError(returnValue, chain);
 * 
 * 	returnValue = chain.addConnection(&timer, &sndFileInput2);
 * 	checkError(returnValue, chain);
 * 
 * 	returnValue = chain.addConnection(&sndFileInput1, &sampConv);
 * 	checkError(returnValue, chain);
 *
 * 	returnValue = chain.addConnection(&sndFileInput2, &alias, false, 0, 0);
 * 	checkError(returnValue, chain);
 * 
 * 	returnValue = chain.addConnection(&sampConv, &mixer);
 * 	checkError(returnValue, chain);
 * 
 * 	returnValue = chain.addConnection(&alias, &mixer);
 * 	checkError(returnValue, chain);
 * 
 * 	returnValue = chain.addConnection(&mixer, &sampEnc);
 * 	checkError(returnValue, chain);
 *
 * 	returnValue = chain.addConnection(&sampEnc, &sndCardOutput);
 * 	checkError(returnValue, chain);
 * \endcode
 *
 * Note that in specifying the connection from the soundfile input
 * component to its alias, the last two parameters of MIPComponentChain::addConnection
 * have been set to zero. This will make sure that no messages are passed
 * from the soundfile component to its alias.
 *
 * Now you may wonder why a construction with an alias is necessary,
 * why it's not possible to simply use the component itself. Suppose
 * we would not use the alias, and we would use the following
 * connections:
 *
 * \code
 * 	returnValue = chain.addConnection(&timer, &sndFileInput2);
 * 	checkError(returnValue, chain);
 * 
 * 	returnValue = chain.addConnection(&sndFileInput2, &sndFileInput2, false, 0, 0);
 * 	checkError(returnValue, chain);
 * 
 * 	returnValue = chain.addConnection(&sndFileInput2, &mixer);
 * 	checkError(returnValue, chain);
 * \endcode
 *
 * In that case we would not create subchains of equal length, but
 * effectively the following situation would be created: 
 *
 * \image html subchains4.png
 *
 * In this chain, it is of course still possible that the same synchronization
 * problem occurs.
